                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Developed by CyberArk Labs, ByteCodeLLM is a state-of-the-art decompilation framework for converting Python bytecode, up to version 3.13, back to source code.<br>
                        Utilizing local large language models (LLMs), it offers unparalleled accuracy and operates entirely on-premise, enhancing both privacy and efficiency.<br>
                        This makes ByteCodeLLM ideal for developers, reverse engineers, and security professionals seeking a reliable tool for reverse engineering and source code recovery without the need for external services.

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Decompilation completeness can vary. Follow these guidelines to enhance success rates:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ByteCodeLLM is optimized for Python 3 bytecode but plans to support other languages in the future.</li>
                        <li>Supported file types include: PYC, EXE (planned), Folder of PYC files (planned).</li>
                        <li>The tool uses <code>pycdc</code> and <code>pycdas</code> for processing, ensure these are installed and paths are configured as per the installation guide.</li>
                        <li>For enhanced decompilation, the LLM can be configured to run locally or remotely, adjusting to your privacy and performance needs.</li>
                        <li>Use the "Separated Files" checkbox if working with multi-file directories to handle each file independently.</li>

                    <p>
                        ByteCodeLLM specializes in decompiling Python bytecode files back to their original source code using advanced local large language models (LLMs). The tool operates by first utilizing <code>pycdc</code> and <code>pycdas</code> to extract the bytecode and generate an initial, often incomplete, source code reconstruction. 
                        <br>
                        For sections of code that <code>pycdc</code> cannot fully decompile, ByteCodeLLM employs finetuned LLMs to interpret the bytecode and fill in the gaps, improving the accuracy and completeness of the decompiled source. This process ensures that even complex or obfuscated Python code can be accurately reconstructed, preserving the original logic and structure as much as possible.
